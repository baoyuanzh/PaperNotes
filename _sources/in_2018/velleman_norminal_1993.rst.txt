===============================================================
Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio Typologies are Misleading
===============================================================


本文共分成 15 小节来说明 S. S. Stevens 的类型系统是误导人的。
在我看来其实只有一个方面，就是 -- 数据属性的类型应该由其在具体问题中的具体含义来决定。

不过我觉得这篇文章写得非常值得学习一下。

首先陈述 S. S. Stevens 的类型系统:

    In the early 1940s, the Harvard psychophysicist S. S. Stenvens coined the term *nominal, ordinal, interval,* and *ratio* to describe a hierarchy of measurement scales [#f1]_ used in psychophysics, and classified statistical procedures according to the scales for which they were "permissible."

然后抛出自己的观点:

    Unfortunately, the use of Stevens's categories in selecting or recommending statistical analysis method is in appropriate and can often be wrong. They do not describe the attributes of real data that is essential to good statistical analysis. Nor do they provides a classification scheme appropriate for modern data analysis methods.

--------------------------------
第一节 Steven's Typology of Data
--------------------------------

以下是具体的分析，其实 Stevens 的有些观点是蛮有意思的：

    ... **Stevens presented a hierarchy of data scales based on invariance of their meaning under different classes of transformations.**

    ... Measurement scales that preserve meaning under a wide variety of transformations in some sense convey less information than those whose meaning is preserved by only a restricted class of transformations. 

    ... Stevens called such a scale *ordinal* if any transformation of the scale value that preserves their numerical order produces another scale that shares the same one-to-one relation between comparisons among objects and comparisons among corresponding scale values. ... Stevens used the term *permissible* to describe the set of transformation that preserves the ...

    ... Interval scales involves a difference (-) instead of order (>) operator, ... Thus linear transformation ... are permissible for interval scale data, but we may not, for example, take *logs*. This is a smaller class of permissible transformation than for ordinal data, suggesting that in some sense the data values carry more information. ... Ratio scales preserve relative ratios, ... Ratio scale data have a defined zero, which may not be changed. Nominal scales ... do not even require ... numerical values, but only of unique identifiers. They are invariant under any transformation that preserves the relationship between individuals and their identifiers. ... **Of course, only the weakest kind of information can survive such arbitrary transformations.**

几个问题的定义

**Representation problem**
    Measurement theorists call the issue involved in assigning scale values to observations the representation problem.
    
**Uniqueness problem**
    They call the invariance of scales under transformations the uniqueness problem.

**Meaningfulness problem**
    Determining the truth or falsity of statements based on comparisons of assigned scale values has been called the meaningfulness problem. [#f2]_

第二节 Prescribing and Proscribing statistics
----------------------------------------------

这一节说的是 Stevens 不仅把他的理念用在一些简单的的运算之上，而是扩展到了 statistical procedures 上面

    He classified not just simple operations, but also statistical procedures according to the scales for which they were "permissible." A scale that preserves meaning under some class of transformations should, ... be restricted to statistics whose meaning would not change were any of those transformations applied to the data.

上面那句英语，我没看懂 :( 我英语不够好。吐槽一下，现在的文章质量普遍在下降，虽然对现在的我来说不见得是件坏事，但实际上是。
下面的举例可以让我稍微理解一下:

    By this reasoning, analyses on nominal data, for example, should be limited to summary statistics such as the numbers of cases, the mode, and contingency correlation, which require only that the identity of the values be preserved. Permissible statistics of ordinal scales included these plus the median, percentiles, and ordinal correlations, that is, statistics whose meanings are preserved when monotone transformations are applied to data. Interval data allowed, in addition, means, standard deviations (although not all common statistics computed with standard deviations), and product moment correlations, becasuse the interpretations of these statistics are unchanged when linear transformations are applied to the data. Finally ratio data allowed all of these plus geometrical means and coefficients of variation, which are unchanged by rescaling the data.

看了上面的举例解释，我理解了，稍微该成我理解的形式， A scale that preserves meaning under some class of transformations should be restricted to statistics whose meaning would not change when any of those transformations were applied to the data.

我感觉我主要是在学英语，哈哈！Luce 的总结更加简洁，

    ... the scale type places [limitations] upon the statistics one may sensibly employ. If the interpretation of a particular statistic or statistical test is altered when admissible  scale transformations are applied, then our substantive conclusion will depend on which arbitrary representation we have used in making our calculations. Most scientists, when they understand the problem, feel that they should shun such statistics and rely only upon those that exhibit the appropriate invariances for the scale type at hand.

我都被说服了，上面说的这有什么不对的吗，不变是多么美好的性质。

-------------------------------------------------------
第三节 Classical Criticisms of Stevens's Proscriptions
-------------------------------------------------------

有个反驳的例子很好玩，先引用下主要观点

    **First**, restricting the choice of statistical choice to those that "exhibit the appropriate invariances for the scale type at hand" is a dangerous practice for data analysis; **Second**, his taxonomy is too strict to apply to real-world data. **Third**, Stevens's proscriptions often lead to degrading data by rank ordering and unnecessarily resorting to nonparametric methods.
    
.. todo::

    什么是 nonparametric methods ? 了解一下

我以为一下这些观点是主要的反驳立场了

    **Lord (1953) show that the choice of permissible statistical tests for a given set of data does not depend on the representation or uniqueness problems, but is concerned instead with meaningfulness.**
    
    Guttman (1977) argued more generally that the statistical interpretation of data depends on the question asked of the data and on the kind of evidence that we would accept to inform us about that question. He defines this evidence in terms of the loss function chosen to fit a model.
    
好玩的例子:

    His note imagined the accusation that a professor who owned the university "football jersey number concession" had peddled unusually low numbers to the Freshman class. Although Lord's professor protests that football numbers are only nominal-scale values, the statisticians he consults is happy to add them up, square them, compute their mean, and perform other operations needed for the application of Tchebycheff's inequality [#f3]_ (avoiding reference to normality) to test the accusation that the numbers were "too low". When the professor protests that these were nominal "football numbers," the statistician remarks that "the numbers don't know where they came from" --- a remark that, in retrospect, may have been a bit too glib for the seriousness of Lord's point.

其实我认为，也许问题主要在于：“所谓的 data 的 meaning 发生在什么地方？”
按照本文的说法，Stevens 的说法过于把数据的意义固定于所考察对象的常见意义（见下面的引用），比如足球服的号码主要是用来区分球员，在这个意义下，数字的大小的确没有意义。
如果学校里的那些新生关注的是这些球衣能否有效的把他们区分开来，那么这个意义是没毛病的。
但是，如果新生们对数字有偏好，那么球衣号码的大小就有了意义，这其实已经是另一回事了。

    (Tukey, 1961) The thus summarized [by Luce] is a dangerous one ...
    Results based on approximate foundations must be used with underlying approximation in mind. Those who seek certainty rather than truth will try to avoid this fact. But what knowledge is not ultimately based on some approximation? And what progress has been made, except with the use of such knowledge.
    
最后一句其实也许有点问题，如果到不了彼岸，倒也没什么，approximation 就是我们借助的舟。
可要是到了彼岸呢，我抛弃这个 approximate 的工具有什么问题。
再说了，certainty 和 truth 有绝对矛盾的地方吗 ？绝对的真理也许绝对确定，而在不确定中建立的真理，是否真理本身的意义就在于不确定呢？比如海森堡测不准？
这个反驳也许有点过头了。

事实上 Stevens 自己也承认，

    there can be a kind of pragmatic sanction: in numerous instances it leads to fruitful results.

所以也可以反过来说，Stevens 的观点也没有那么绝对，他只是没有明确意识到 meaning 真正产生的那个地方。

-------------------------------------------------------
第四节 Controversy over Statistics and Scale Types
-------------------------------------------------------

measurement theorist （这是什么理论专家，测度理论专家？）通常总结到 statistical methods must be constrained by the scale type of the data. 本文的立场主要是在“如何看待理论测度在统计上应用时，是否可以用 scale type 来选择统计方法上”的。其反对的主要理由在于，这样做在实际过程中行不通。

    The differences in viewpoint stem in part from a fundamental difference between mathematics and science.
    Tukey (1962) noted this difference in separating data analysis from mathematical statistics:
    
        There are diverse views as to what makes a science, but three constituents will be judged by most, viz:
        
        * (a1) intellectual content;
        * (a2) organization into an understandable form;
        * (a3) reliance upon the test of experience as the ultimate standard of validity
        
        By these tests, mathematics is not a science, since its ultimate standard of validity is an agree-upon sort of logical consistency and provability.

-------------------------------------------------------
第五节 Alternative Scale Taxonomies
-------------------------------------------------------

这一节的主要观点是，还存在其他的分类方式，而且这些分类方式并不限制可以使用的 transformations, 而且也从来没有宣称包含了一切可能性，只是作为某种 first aid ways to transform data values, 这些 transformation 甚至包含将一种类型的的数据通过转换迁移到另一种数据。
比如这里面有一种叫做 counted fractions 的类型，也就是在 0 和 1 之内的 ratio.
对于这个类型的数据，要放到 Stevens 四种类型中的哪一种之中呢？因为它要求的 0 和 1 边界不允许任何 scale shift.

-------------------------------------------------------
第六节 Proscribing Transformations
-------------------------------------------------------




-------------------------------------------------------
第七节 Good Data Analysis Does NOT Assume Data Types
-------------------------------------------------------

    Things are seldom what they seem.
    
    Data that appear to have one type in fact hide other information
    
上面的第二句话有个例子，零售店的结账口一般来说是有标号的，这些标号可以认为是 nominal 的，因为它们只是用来区分不同的结账口。
但不可否认的是，具有以下这种可能性，这些带有顺序的 ID 号和结账口之间的开张顺序是相对应的，据此，我们也许可以来探索 ID 号和其他一些重要变量之间的联系。

我个人认为，这个还是很有道理的，虽然一个超级强大的学习机面对即使是乱排的 ID 号，也可以来探索某种存在的关系，但是实际生活中，缺少这种天然的对应关系，要找到本来存在的联系相对来说就变得困难了。
比如如果顺序是相对应的，我们可以找到一种线性关系，那么当打乱 ID 时，这种线性的 pattern 就变得模糊不清，甚至像是被藏起来了。

而且 Joiner 继续说到，实际上得到的实验数据总是离完美有那么一点点差距，比如对照实验要求除了感兴趣的因素外的其他应该完全相同，然而这是很难做到的。
比如关动物的笼子，放在上面的和放在下面的看到的景色是不一样的，本来，动物是要完全随机地被分配到笼子里，可实际上，离完全随机总是有一些差距。
因此，

    A careful data analyst should not assume that the scale type of a variable is what it appears to be even when clear assurances are made about the data.
